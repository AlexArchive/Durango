Durango serves as an unofficial read-only API client for Xbox LIVEÂ®. 

The solution is comprised of both a web service and a standalone class library that can be used independently of the web service to interface with Xbox Live.

### Status

Unfortunately this library has been rendered dysfunctional by the latest changes to the Xbox website from where the data is parsed.
